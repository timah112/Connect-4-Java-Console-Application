# Connect-4-Java-Console-Application
A 2-Player Connect-4 game I  programmed from scratch using core Java SE7. This is a console application that takes payers' inputs such as their Piece and the column number they wish to put their piece in. I built my own algorithm using depth-first-search on a matrix to detect for a connect-4 of the same pieces for a player.
